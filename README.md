# hapi-jwt-auth-es6
<code>npm install</code>

<code>node bootstrap.js</code>

Project based on https://github.com/auth0-blog/hapi-jwt-authentication

And conversion to ES6 inspired from this article https://scotch.io/tutorials/making-a-restful-api-with-hapi-js


### NOTE ###
This project is just for the purpose of learning Hapijs, JWT and ES6 syntax. The codes that I changed are very minimal. For example
<code>const Hapi = require('hapi')</code> to <code>import Hapi from 'hapi'</code>. Hope this help and feel free to improve the codes (especially the ES6 syntax), as I am still new to these technology.
